# colmar-academy
This is my capstone for Code Academy's Build a Website course.<br>
The project was to make a landing page for a fictional school, Colmar Academy.<br>
I was provided a design spec and the images, and did the coding from scratch.<br>
The page is responsive for both desktop and mobile.
