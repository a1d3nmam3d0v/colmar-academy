# colmar-academy
This is the capstone for Code Academy's 'Build a Website with HTML, CSS and Github Pages' course. The project was to make the landing page of a fictional school, Colmar Academy.
I was provided the design spec (below) and did the coding from scratch.
The page is responsive for both desktop and mobile.
