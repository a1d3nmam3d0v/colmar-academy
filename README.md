# colmar-academy
This is the capstone for Code Academy's 'Build a Website with HTML, CSS and Github Pages' course.<br>
The project is to make a landing page for a fictional school, Colmar Academy.<br>
I was provided the design spec (below) and the images, and did the coding from scratch.<br>
The page is responsive for both desktop and mobile.
